# Predictive-Maintenance

PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE <br>
Project aim is to develop a Predictive Maintenance System using machine learning  that can analyze historical and real-time 
sensor data to detect patterns, predict failures in advance, and optimize maintenance schedules. 

• Performed comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering on equipment maintenance dataset. 
Implemented advanced techniques to extract key predictive indicators for failure analysis. 

• Built and evaluated multiple ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes) for equipment failure 
prediction. Utilized ROC-AUC metrics to compare model performance and select optimal solution. 

• Successfully deployed Naive Bayes classifier as final production model for maintenance predictions. Enabled 
proactive equipment failure detection and maintenance scheduling.
